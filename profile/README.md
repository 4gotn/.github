# Forgotten Bits: A Programmer's Guide to SE + AI Wisdom

"Forgotten Bits" bridges the gap between software engineering (SE)
practices and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the
often-overlooked knowledge that can propel both fields forward.
This project distills core principles, methodologies, and lessons
from decades of SE and AI research. Itâ€™s designed to help programmers
navigate complex challenges with simple, yet powerful, approaches,
ensuring they apply the right tools at the right time. Through this
guide, we aim to make advanced topics like optimization, defect
prediction, and AI applications more accessible and actionable for
software developers and engineers.
